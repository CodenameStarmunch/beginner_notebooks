## This repo contains some of the early work I completed during my Machine Learning journey (and all are committed to the main branch for lulz).  

### Some points to note are: 

#### 1:  They may suck.
#### 2:  The main focus was on EDA as opposed to ML, as my interest was primarily on data analysis and dabbling in dataa science for business analysis. 
#### 3:  It is likely that some of the visualisations have not rendered here due to most, if not all of these projects being created using Deepnote's built-in vis tools.
#### 4:  As they were created around two yesrr prior to me going deep into ML, these projects do not represent my current skill level (>= 2025). 
#### 5:  Continuing along that vain (/vane? Vein?!), although they are old, i'm still quite proud of what I learned along the way and how some of these turned out. 
#### 6:  As the focus wasn't primarily on the ML, the ML might suck.  Also:  See 1. 
#### 7:  I created these on the side of doing a pretty hardcore physical job with long hours and stayed up all night for my days off to do them, and I was learning as I went, so please forgive whatever mistakes may exist. 
#### 8:  I do know to never commit to main, panic not. 
#### 9:  If you've any questions regarding data origin, please send a SAE and I will endeavour to respond in writing at the earliest available opportunity.

### Employee attrition notebook information. 

##### The experience I gained from the employee attrition project surprisingly proved valuable during my first freelance gig.  The job came at a time when I was wondering why I had gone through 200 projects' worth of slog with no end in sight and took a chance on applying for some side-jobs to test my knowledge.  So my advice to any noobs here is that sometimes the practise projects may seem pointless and possibly even don't contain the sort of data that you would ordinarily see yourself using at any point in time, but please be aware that anything might come up at any time, and it's better to have the experience and not need it than to need it and not have it.  With this experience and the additional experience gained in other projects over the year leading up to the aformentioned freelance job, I wasn't just able to analyse the company in question, but I was able to consult the business on how to collect the data required to enhance their operations.  The stakeholder had a very rough idea of what they wanted from their employee optimisation program, but they didn't have the data.  Not only that, they didn't think the data existed, and if it did, they didn't know how to collect it, or what points to collect before hiring a person to help use the data to implement some efficiency standards / strategies.  So although this project felt pointless (af) at the time, it led to the creation of a 25-column-strong dataframe of data points which I pinpointed within the company and helped boost "fulfilment" (happiness) almost threefold vs. the previous year after six months of the processes being implimented, post-analysis.

### Beverage stores analysis information.

##### Nothing particularly special to see here besides a good realtime learning curve once my first data certification had been earned.

###Â Premier league notebook information.

##### This was one of several 'dive in and figure things out' projects I completed.  I do / did these because I felt that there would be times in the future where there are no SMEs available, and completing projects using business data (etc.) meant that I wasn't particularly out of my comfort zone; in some instances I knew the outcome either before the project was started, or early on in the project after looking at a few of the variables, so I was working towards a predermined conclusion and mostly completing the project to pick up some technological skills.  With this project I was blind re: the data, but at this point I had some more hard skills to test out.
