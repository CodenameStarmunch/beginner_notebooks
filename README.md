## This repo contains some of the early work I completed during my Machine Learning journey (and all are committed to the main branch for lulz).  

### Some points to note are: 

#### 1:  They may suck.
#### 2:  The manin focus was on EDA as opposed to ML, as my interest was primarily on data analysis and dabbling in dataa science for business analysis. 
#### 3:  It is likely that some fo the visualisations have not rendered due to most, if not all of these projects being created using Deepnote's built-in vis tools.
#### 4:  These do not represent my current skill level, as most were created around two yesrr prior to me going deep into ML. 
#### 5:  Continuing along that vain (/vane? Vein?!), although they are old, i'm still quite proud of what I learned along the way and how some of these turned out. 
#### 6:  As the focus wasn't primarily on the ML, the ML might suck. 
#### 7:  I created these on the side of doing a pretty hardcore physical job with long hours and stayed up all night for my days off to do them, so please forgive whatever mistakes may exist. 
#### 8:  I do know to never commit to main, panic not.
